# Covid-19 Risk Management Data Analysis

Geographic Data Analysis for Covid-19 Risk Management


## Getting Started

_provide very short code sample and result to give a grasp of what the project is about and what's achievable with the code (ideally some quick map visualization)_

Setup a configuration json file to suit the geodataframe you wish to generate, for example :

```json
{
  "MAPBOX_API_KEY": "your.personnal.key",
  "country_name": "Morocco",
  "window_size": 500
}
```

and then run from `src` directory
```bash
$ python make_geodataframe.py --config=path_to_config --o=output_name
```
